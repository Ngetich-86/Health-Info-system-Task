## My Approach

### API First
I started by designing all the backend endpoints before developing the frontend. This allowed me to establish a clear API structure and ensure the frontend would have all the data it needed. 

### Schema Design
I modeled the database tables for clients, programs, and enrollments using **Drizzle ORM**. This provided a clear structure for data relationships and helped me keep track of entities like users, health programs, and their enrollments.

### Authentication
For secure API access, I implemented **JWT authentication**. This ensures that only authenticated users can access sensitive endpoints, keeping the system secure.

### Clean Architecture
I focused on a clean and maintainable architecture by separating concerns between routes, services, and database logic. This helps in scaling the project and keeping the codebase easy to navigate.

### Responsive UI
I used **TailwindCSS** to create a simple, mobile-friendly, and clean user interface. This approach allowed me to quickly style the app with minimal overhead while ensuring it would be responsive across devices.

### Documentation
I made sure to write clear comments and keep the codebase clean to make it easy for others to understand and contribute.

### The Process
Here's my step-by-step approach:
1. **Backend Development:** I began by designing my schemas and setting up the database. I created models for users, health programs, and their enrollments.
2. **Controllers:** I wrote controllers for each model and designed API endpoints to handle client requests (e.g., client registration, health program enrollment).
3. **Testing:** I used **Postman** to test all the API endpoints and ensure they were working correctly before moving to the frontend.
4. **Frontend Setup:** Once the backend was ready, I set up the frontend using **React** with **TypeScript** and **TailwindCSS** for styling.
5. **Redux for Authentication:** I implemented **Redux** to manage authentication state across the app, allowing users to log in, register, and manage their sessions.
6. **Pages and Components:** I set up pages for different sections of the app, such as client registration, program management, and user profiles, ensuring a smooth and intuitive UI/UX.
